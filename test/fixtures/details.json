The food is fast casual, freshly made, and actually pretty decent quality which is a nice surprise. I've eaten (and drank) here on numerous occasions, and find the atmosphere, cleanliness, and quality (for the price) above expectations. It can be a little on the casual side of fast food - meaning if you're in a hurry to catch a bus, it may not be the best choice - but it will certainly be better than eating greasy bus station food and will be cheaper too. I mainly order burgers, but have been told the mac and cheese is good as well. ",

Their burgers are juicy, their chicken tenders crispy, and their fries are hand cut and fried to perfection. Everything is made to order and fresh off the grill, making it worth the wait when you finally get to bite into that goodness.\n\nThe only thing I've never tried on their menu were the salads, but I'm sure they're all good since they look awesome whenever I see them on a tray going to another table.\n\nMy absolute favorites are the Schnipper's Chicken Filet (a crispy tender chicken sandwich with their own special Schnippers sauce), their mac and cheese, and their Mac and Joe - a mixture of the aforementioned dish with Sloppy Joe meat (no bun). \n\n",
